      <description>In 2018 I was lucky enough to play a lot of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but I did not not do a lot of DMing, just four sessions of Tales From The Loop.
This year I&amp;rsquo;d like to run a campaign, starting from soon until the end of the year.
Here are my top six(!) I would like to run&amp;hellip;
Forgotten Realms Game system: Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5E
Pick this if you like the sound of: Classic fantasy roleplaying action and adventure, immersion in the official world of D&amp;amp;D, the world of Drizzt!</description>

      <description>It has been mentioned many times that RPG enthusiasts will often spend much more time reading about games than actually playing them. This is certainly true for me, evidenced by the ever-growing collection of games I have, coupled with the ever-decreasing amount of time I am able to co-ordinate to run or play them.
I also have a parallel interest in game design. So when I am reading an RPG product, my daydreaming is going in a few different directions; what would it be like to play this game, what would it be like to run this game, and how was it designed?</description>
