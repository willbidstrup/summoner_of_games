At the [London Indie RPG Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/) we played [Dawn Of Worlds](http://www.clanwebsite.org/games/rpg/Dawn_of_Worlds_game_1_0Final.pdf); a collaborative game where the players co-create an epic fantasy world. It was an interesting, fun, somewhat hilarious experience, here is the result…

# Mighty events that shaped our world

*From the jagged-toothed maw of un-knowable depths, a pillar of Eternal Flame rises!*

*A great serpent is seen moving through the whirlpool ridden seas, thirsting for the riches of the deeps!*

*Iak emerges, a blind dog that spreads death in his wake!*

*Thock-ta, bird-priest of the mountains sows discontent throughout the realm!*

*Salamanders learn the skills of Fire Art and then Fire Magic, lead by the great Dagon Fire-Eater whose destiny is to consume the Eternal Flame of the Shadow People!*

*Goat-People form a Holy Order Of Two Legs and in retaliation, the People-Goats form the Quadruped Military Alliance!*


# DM/Designer Notes

This game felt like an analog combination of three good games; SimEarth, Warlords and Civilisation. 

The game would be perfect as a session zero for a truly dedicated gaming group that wanted to co-create a world to then go and adventure in. I’d suggest a few ways to reduce the scope from ‘anything you can imagine’ to maybe a set of pre-defined choices, similar to the Fiasco sets.

Our group was a group of strangers, united by a love of lesser-known RPGs, and I thought we found a good groove and created an interesting and fun experience. One thing we agreed might be a good thing for next time would be a rotating first player and a kind of soft rule where each subsequent player needs to bounce off the initial players idea. I thought we were good at bouncing off each other but a tighter frame may have promoted even more convoluted conflicts and resolutions.

The game experience also might have been improved with some better paper and pencils, or even a whiteboard - big thanks to Robert who was the best organised and able to provide what we needed.
