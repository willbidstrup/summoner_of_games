    <p>At the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/">London Indie RPG Meetup</a> we played <a href="http://www.clanwebsite.org/games/rpg/Dawn_of_Worlds_game_1_0Final.pdf">Dawn Of Worlds</a>; a collaborative game where the players co-create an epic fantasy world. It was an interesting, fun, somewhat hilarious experience, here is the result…</p>

<h1>Mighty events that shaped our world</h1>
<p><em>From the jagged-toothed maw of un-knowable depths, a pillar of Eternal Flame rises!</em></p>
<p><em>A great serpent is seen moving through the whirlpool ridden seas, thirsting for the riches of the deeps!</em></p>
<p><em>Iak emerges, a blind dog that spreads death in his wake!</em></p>
<p><em>Thock-ta, bird-priest of the mountains sows discontent throughout the realm!</em></p>
<p><em>Salamanders learn the skills of Fire Art and then Fire Magic, lead by the great Dagon Fire-Eater whose destiny is to consume the Eternal Flame of the Shadow People!</em></p>
<p><em>Goat-People form a Holy Order Of Two Legs and in retaliation, the People-Goats form the Quadruped Military Alliance!</em></p>

<h1>DM/Designer Notes</h1>
<p>This game felt like an analog combination of three good games; SimEarth, Warlords and Civilisation.</p>
<p>The game would be perfect as a session zero for a truly dedicated gaming group that wanted to co-create a world to then go and adventure in. I’d suggest a few ways to reduce the scope from ‘anything you can imagine’ to maybe a set of pre-defined choices, similar to the Fiasco sets.</p>
<p>Our group was a group of strangers, united by a love of lesser-known RPGs, and I thought we found a good groove and created an interesting and fun experience. One thing we agreed might be a good thing for next time would be a rotating first player and a kind of soft rule where each subsequent player needs to bounce off the initial players idea. I thought we were good at bouncing off each other but a tighter frame may have promoted even more convoluted conflicts and resolutions.</p>
<p>The game experience also might have been improved with some better paper and pencils, or even a whiteboard - big thanks to Robert who was the best organised and able to provide what we needed.</p>
