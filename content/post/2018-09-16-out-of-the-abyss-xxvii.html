<p>The 27th episode of Out Of The Abyss ended with us victoriously returning to Blingdenstone.</p>

<h1>The King Of The Dead Pudding King</h1>
<p>“This is my tiger” says the chipper halfling who lounges easily at the bar in The Foaming Mug.<br />
Salazar is not so sure, but is diplomatic as always.<br />
“Remarkable… your tiger must be rare indeed, one could be mistaken for believing it is a house-cat.”<br />
She smiles sweetly. “I don’t expect you to understand, few have seen a tiger in real life and fewer have lived to tell the tale. I’m Cameila, pleased to meet you!”</p>

<p>The newly-appointed General Gadreel reviews the forces at her command. Grand Master Wizard Lyssiwick Oversprocket, High Priest Tredrea Meksoith, Master Of Abjuration Malus Jaxly, Mistress Of Beasts Cameila and an assortment of deep gnomes. This group must fight for their lives and the safety of Blingdenstone against a horde of deathly oozes under the command of demonic forces beyond mortal understanding.<br />
”Salazar, I’m going to need you to help me with some kind of rousing speech…”</p>

<p>The Pudding King lies dead following a deadly power in which might and magic were brought in full force by Salazar’s Traveling Companions.<br />
Tredrea approaches the corpse and is struck with inspiration, a deep calling from his goddess. He mutters a foul incantation and wills the body into a unnatural state of undeath.<br />
“Rise…rise… now I am YOUR King and Umberlee is your Queen!”</p>

<h1>DM/Designer Notes</h1>
<p>We introduced a new character (not player) to the party, Cameila the halfling druid. She earned friends and respect for her mighty nature magic and friendly can-do attitude. We’ve had lots of NPCs and random one-game characters join us over the weeks, but this was the first brand new full-time character.</p>
<p>It was fun to be set up as being part of a bigger battle. We may of been able to contribute more except for being slowed down by hordes of oozes. Interestingly, the battle before the final battle felt more difficult, evidence of the trickiness in balancing these higher-level encounters.</p>
