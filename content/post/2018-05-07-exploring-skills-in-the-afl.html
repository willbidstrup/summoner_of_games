<p><strong>Update: There is far less of a relationship between goal accuracy and margin than originally published - I’ve fixed the error in code below which was using Away.Points instead of Away.Behinds in calculating goal-kicking accuracy.</strong></p>
<p>Today I practice ggplot2 and investigate skills in the AFL.</p>
<p>The #AFLWonkWednesdays week 2 topic is;</p>
<p><em>What is going on with skills?</em></p>
<p><em>There has been a lot of chatter about the quality of skills and goal kicking in the AFL of late. The greats have had their say. Goal kicking is at HISTORIC lows (since 1990). The league is even on scoring trend watch.</em></p>
<p><em>But what do the wonks think?</em></p>
<p>I think I am too new to AFL stats to call myself a wonk but I will tell you what I think - even though watching a slew of points is frustrating, it might be a signal of a better (more exciting, lower margin of victory) game.</p>
<p><strong>Update: After fixing the goal-kicking accuracy calculation I still don’t care about increasing goal-accuracy as it seems to have no effect on if a game will be tight or not, which is my ‘success’ criteria</strong></p>
