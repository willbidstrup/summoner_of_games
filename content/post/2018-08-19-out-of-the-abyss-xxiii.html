<p>The 23rd episode of Out Of The Abyss ended with us barely alive in search of a sunken temple.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the look of that Jimjar fellow…” says Gadreel as she watches Lyssiwick walk up the stairs with the rakish gnome adventurer. “Don’t worry, I have a plan” says the gnomish wizard, “this is all for the Greater Good”.</p>

<p>“I have consulted with The Order Of Brilliance” says Tredrea. “ And I have dire news; there are fell and demonic forces loose in The Underdark, and they have been summoned from somewhere else! Probably the Abyss.” There is stunned silence.</p>

<p>“I have consulted The Wavemother and we must proceed yonder. We must climb the Hill Of Difficulty” said Tredrea.<br />
“Must we really listen to this so-called Goddess?” said Hjulnik.</p>

<p>I liked the very powerful banshee wail which took me from full strength to zero hit points with one save. It was scary.</p>
<p>We encountered some interesting monster combinations, in particular a spectre, a mimic and a something-else-that-got-killed. The mix of spell effects, PC abilities and monster abilities makes mid/higher tier combat very engaging. While I am lured to other systems for quicker narrative and mystery play, one part of the the lasting appeal of D&amp;D is evident in the strategic combat.</p>
