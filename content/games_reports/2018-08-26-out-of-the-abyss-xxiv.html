<h1>There must be something nearby that can turn people to stone…</h1>
<p>The stone structure seems timeless, an ancient an holy site where gnomes have worshipped their gods of stone and earth…until recently. A foulness lies about the air, and as the holy ruby is clicked into place, you hear the keen wailing of the undead approaching…</p>

<p>Gadreel summons a spell of healing and restores Tredrea’s vitality, for the third time in 20 seconds. “This was NOT the Wavemother” she says cheerily. “Just so you know.” Tredrea stands, shakily. “Surely the Wavemother has blessed yo-” “Just stop.”</p>

<p>DM: The room is full of pieces of art and treasure.<br />
Rogue: I rush in and push everyone out of the way, the treasure is mine.<br />
DM: Roll initiative.<br />
Rogue: I’m first!<br />
DM: You see a medusa, roll a save.<br />
Rogue: (rolls)<br />
DM: You turn to stone. Have you got another character?</p>

<h1>DM/Designer Notes</h1>
<p>We had a climactic battle today and were lucky enough to be semi-prepared. The spell magic circle evened the odds a bit, in what was a deadly encounter with many undead, included my favourites, banshees, and an undead mind flayer. The various wails and gaze attacks had my character on the floor multiple times. Lucky magic circle doesn’t take concentration.</p>
<p>We had an interesting example of being first not being the best when our rogue was turned to stone by a medusa. Thinking about it now, I wonder if he should have acted first and then been turned to stone on the medusa’s turn. I won’t bring that up anytime soon… Because of this, we had our first PC death today. Well, it was more of a PC petrification. It was scary and impactful.</p>
