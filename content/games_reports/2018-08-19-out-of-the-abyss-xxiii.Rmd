The 23rd episode of Out Of The Abyss ended with us barely alive in search of a sunken temple.

“I don’t like the look of that Jimjar fellow…” says Gadreel as she watches Lyssiwick walk up the stairs with the rakish gnome adventurer.
“Don’t worry, I have a plan” says the gnomish wizard, “this is all for the Greater Good”.

“I have consulted with The Order Of Brilliance” says Tredrea. “ And I have dire news; there are fell and demonic forces loose in The Underdark, and they have been summoned from somewhere else! Probably the Abyss.”
There is stunned silence.

“I have consulted The Wavemother and we must proceed yonder. We must climb the Hill Of Difficulty” said Tredrea.  
“Must we really listen to this so-called Goddess?” said Hjulnik.



# DM/Designer Notes


I liked the very powerful banshee wail which took me from full strength to zero hit points with one save. It was scary. 

We encountered some interesting monster combinations, in particular a spectre, a mimic and a something-else-that-got-killed. The mix of spell effects, PC abilities and monster abilities makes mid/higher tier combat very engaging. While I am lured to other systems for quicker narrative and mystery play, one part of the the lasting appeal of D&D is evident in the strategic combat.
