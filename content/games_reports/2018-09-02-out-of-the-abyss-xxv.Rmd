The 25th episode of Out Of The Abyss ended with us at the end of a trap-filled corridor.

# Eldritch Knights, Battle Masters, Were-rats and Oozes

“Bryson Hardcastle, Commissioned Adventurer” says the half-elf by way of introduction, extending a gloved hand and delivering a handshake that is supple yet strong and wholly professional. “Now, what kind of trouble have you gotten yourselves into?”  
“I am Salazar and these are my companions. We are fully capable I assure you, however we would be pleased to retain your services. Do you accept notes of credit?”

The Svirfneblin leaders present The Guardian to the newest visitor to the deep city, the latest to take The Test.  
“Something about him is not right,” one of them whispers. “He’s shifting around…like a drow!”  
In flash the half-elf stabs the cat with his dagger and there are screams of protest and rage. Tredrea intervenes and rescues the animal but Adlar has sealed his fate as a Person of Interest in Blingdenstone. Only the reputation of Gadreel saves him from prison, or worse…

The goliath, Malus Jaxley, stomps bravely through the trap ridden corridor, impervious to the darts that whizz pass him, or in many cases, into him. 
“Right, there we go!” he says grasping a were-rat in his huge arms. “Now, back the way we came.”  
The party is stunned to see Malus turn and walk back towards them, deliberately stepping on the pressure plates that control the release of the darts. Malus holds the were-rat against the wall as a shield and in a few moments his foe lies dead in his arms, full of deadly poison.   
“Genius,” breathes Gadreel.  
Tredrea grins and breaks out into a slow clap.  


# DM/Designer Notes

In this session and the next, we are introduced to the power of the Battle Master fighter archetype. I’ve always wanted to play one. They are tough, smart, can buff the party and have lots of flavourful moves. This will be my next D&D character.  

We had a new player join us and I find it interesting to see it when someone’s first character is a reclusive, psychopathic assassin drow. I have seen this happen more than once. I wonder if it’s a common thing around D&D tables, and if it is something that is changing as the memories of World Of Warcraft rogues fade and more players are inspired to join after watching collaborative groups play on streams?
