>““Exploration is curiosity put into action.”  
> ― **Don Walsh**  

 
Welcome to my personal learning journal where I share snippets of code, works-in-progress, thoughts, experiments, analyses, wrangling, visualizing, modelling and anything else I play around with that falls broadly into the category of scientific exploration or doing things with data.  

I'm Australian born, New Guinea raised, living in London.    

I have worked in factories, farms, juice stations, theatres, bars and offices.   

I now work at [Publicis.Sapient](https://publicis.sapient.com/content/psredesign/en-us.html).   

Some things I like include heavy metal on 10, chilli, cybermen, tabletop roleplaying games and whisky.
